# Project Items Rule

## Required Fields

Every project item MUST have:

| Field | Required | Options |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Status | Yes | See workflow below |
| Priority | Yes | Critical / High / Medium / Low |
| Size | Recommended | XS / S / M / L / XL |
| Type | Yes | Organization Issue Types (manual setup) |

## Status Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
  Pending2[Pending] --> Backlog --> InProgress[In Progress]
  InProgress --> Review --> DoneOpen["Done(Open)"]
  InProgress <--> OnHold[On Hold]
  Review <--> OnHold
  Backlog --> Cancelled
  InProgress --> Cancelled
  Closed[Closed/Done]
  DoneOpen -->|cascades Close on parent Close| Closed
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pending | Not yet triaged |
| Backlog | Planned work. Requirements may still need refinement |
| In Progress | Currently working on (planning, design, or implementation) |
| On Hold | Blocked (document reason) |
| Review | AI work complete, human review possible (plan approval gate or code review pending) |
| Done(Open) | Sub-issue work complete. GitHub Issue remains Open. Closed automatically when parent Issue closes |
| Done / Closed | Completed and closed |
| Cancelled | Explicitly not planned (set by `items cancel`) |

> **@deprecated**: `Ready` and `Completed` are retained for backward compatibility with existing Issues but must not be used as new transition targets. Escape paths only: `Ready → In Progress`, `Completed → Done`.

### items approve and Done(Open) State

`items approve {number}` is a dedicated CLI command to transition a Review-status Issue to Done(Open) (ADR-v3-013).

- **Transition**: Review → Done (GitHub Issue state remains Open)
- **Fails if not Review**: exits with `result: "error"` and exit 1
- **JSON output**: `{ "result": "ok" | "error", "message": "...", "next_suggestions": [...] }`

Done(Open) is an intermediate state indicating "sub-issue work complete but Issue kept Open". When the parent Issue is closed, `syncChildCloseOnParentClose` automatically closes all Done(Open) child Issues.

### PR Status Workflow

PRs use the same Status field as Issues, operating on a subset of the Issue workflow. Detailed review state is managed by GitHub's native PR `review_decision` (APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED / REVIEW_REQUIRED).

| Status | Description | Transition Trigger |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Review | Immediately after PR creation | Auto-set by `items pr create` when adding PR to Projects |
| Done | After merge | Auto-set by `items pr merge` |

**Unused statuses**: Backlog, Pending, Ready, In Progress, On Hold, Completed, and Cancelled do not apply to PRs.

> `items integrity` detects PR status inconsistencies (OPEN PR with Done status, MERGED/CLOSED PR with active status, issue-only statuses on PRs).

### Two-Layer Status Model (Epics / Sub-Issues)

Epic Issue status is **auto-derived** from sub-issue states. Manual updates are generally unnecessary.

| Sub-Issue State | Effect on Parent Issue |
|----------------|----------------------|
| All sub-issues Done(Open) or Done | Parent auto-transitions to Done |
| Some In Progress / Review | Parent stays In Progress |
| Some Done(Open) + rest Backlog | Parent stays In Progress (treated as in-progress) |
| All sub-issues Cancelled | Parent auto-reverts to Backlog |

**Cascading Close on parent close**: When a parent Issue is closed, all Done(Open) child Issues are automatically closed via `syncChildCloseOnParentClose`.

**Reactive auto-derivation**: The CLI detects sub-issue status changes during `items transition`, `items close` (including `items cancel`), `items update-status`, and `items pr merge`, then auto-derives and updates the parent status. Explicit `items integrity --fix` is not required (still available for batch consistency checks).

### Plan Reset Flow

To reset an epic's plan from scratch (when sub-issues already exist):

1. Set all sub-issues to Cancelled via `items cancel {sub-numbers}` (CLI auto-transitions parent to Backlog)
2. Re-plan with `prepare-flow`

### Idea → Issue Flow

Ideas and proposals start as **Discussions** (Research or Knowledge category), not Issues.

| Stage | Location | When to Move |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Idea / exploration | Discussion | When the idea is first raised |
| Decided to do | Issue (Backlog) | When the team agrees to implement |
| Requirements firm | Issue (Review) | When requirements need formal review |

## Size Estimation

| Size | Time | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| XS | ~1h | Typo fix, config change |
| S | ~4h | Small feature, bug fix |
| M | ~1d | Medium feature |
| L | ~3d | Large feature |
| XL | 3d+ | Epic (should be split) |

## Body Template

```markdown
## Purpose
{who} can {what}. {why}.

## Summary
{What this item does}

## Background
{Current problems, relevant constraints and dependencies}

## Considerations
- {Perspectives and constraints for the planning phase}

## Deliverable
{What "done" looks like}
```

> For type-specific templates (bug reproduction steps, research investigation items, etc.), see the `create-item` reference.

## Status Update Triggers

AI MUST update issue status at these points:

| Trigger | Action | Owner | Command |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Planning started | → In Progress + assign | `prepare-flow` | `items transition {n} --to "In Progress"` |
| Plan created | → Review | `prepare-flow` | `items transition {n} --to Review` |
| Design started | → In Progress | `design-flow` | `items transition {n} --to "In Progress"` |
| Design complete | → Review | `design-flow` | `items transition {n} --to Review` |
| User approves plan, starts work | → In Progress + branch | `implement-flow` | `items transition {n} --to "In Progress"` |
| implement-flow chain complete | → Review | `implement-flow` | `items transition {n} --to Review` (after PR creation, simplify, security-review, work summary) |
| User explicitly approves | → Done(Open) | `approve` skill / manual | `items approve {n}` |
| review-flow starts | → In Progress | `review-flow` | `items transition {n} --to "In Progress"` |
| review-flow response complete | → Review | `review-flow` | `items transition {n} --to Review` |
| PR merged | → Done | `commit-issue` (via `pr merge`) | Automatic |
| Blocked by dependency | → On Hold | Manual | `items transition {n} --to "On Hold"` + comment |
| Complete (no PR needed) | → Done | Manual | `items update-status --done {n}` |
| Cancelled | → Cancelled | `items cancel` | `items cancel {n}` |
| Plan approved | → Done (plan issue) | `implement-flow` | `items transition {plan-n} --to Done` (for epics: only after all work sub-issues are Done) |

> **GitHub Projects built-in automation**: When the `Pull request linked to issue` workflow is enabled, linking a PR to an Issue automatically adds both to the Project. Date fields (Start at / Review at / End at) on the PR are set automatically by `items integrity`. See the "GitHub Projects Workflow Configuration" section in `github-commands.md` for setup instructions.

### In Progress Usage (Planning and Implementation)

- **Purpose**: Visibility that active work is in progress (planning, design, or implementation)
- **Entry**: `prepare-flow` sets this status when planning starts; `design-flow` sets when design starts; `implement-flow` sets when implementation begins
- **Exit**: Work complete → Review

### Review Usage (AI Work Complete, Human Review Possible)

Review means "AI work is complete and human review is possible". Used in two contexts:

**1. Plan Approval Gate (plan issues / regular issues)**
- **Entry**: `prepare-flow` sets this status after plan review passes
- **Exit**: User approves → `implement-flow` starts implementation → In Progress

**2. Code Review Pending (after implementation)**
- **Entry**: Set by `implement-flow` after entire chain completes (implementation, tests, PR creation, simplify, security-review, work summary)
- **Exit**: Review complete → Testing or Done

> **Important**: Review is NOT set at PR creation time. AI work steps (`/simplify`, security review) remain after PR creation, so the transition happens only after all steps complete.

### Rules

1. **One In Progress at a time** - Move previous item out before starting new one (exception: batch mode, epics)
2. **Branch per issue** - Create a feature branch when starting work (exception: batch, epics)
3. **Event-driven**: Status changes happen immediately when events occur
4. **Pending requires reason** - Add a comment explaining the blocker
5. **Idempotency** - If status is already correct, skip the update (no error)

### CLI and GitHub Projects Workflows Responsibility Division

GitHub Projects has built-in Workflows (e.g., `Item closed` → set Status to Done), and the CLI's `items close` also sets Status to Done. This can result in the same Status update being executed twice.

| Operation | CLI Responsibility | Workflows Responsibility | Duplicate Execution |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Issue close | `items close` sets Status → Done | `Item closed` sets Status → Done | Yes (idempotent) |
| PR merge | `items pr merge` sets Status → Done | `Pull request merged` sets Status → Done | Yes (idempotent) |
| Issue reopen | `items reopen` restores Status | `Item reopened` sets Status → Backlog | Potential conflict |

**Principles:**
- CLI performs **authoritative Status updates** (including timestamp updates and parent issue derivation)
- Workflows act as a **backstop** (covering manual operations that bypass the CLI)
- Duplicate execution is harmless due to idempotency
- On reopen, CLI's Status restore and Workflows' Backlog setting may conflict; Workflows may overwrite after CLI execution. If conflicted, correct with `shirokuma-docs items update-status {number} --status {correct-status}`

## Initial Status Constraint at Issue Creation

When creating an Issue with `items add issue`, the following initial statuses are allowed in the `status` field:

| Status | Allowed | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `Pending` | Yes | Triage-pending issues |
| `Backlog` | Yes | Normal new issues (default) |
| `Review` and later | No | Transition via `items transition` after creation |

**Plan Issue creation procedure:**

```bash
# 1. Create with Backlog (Review cannot be specified)
shirokuma-docs items add issue --file /tmp/shirokuma-docs/{n}-plan-issue.md
# 2. Transition to Review in 2 steps (Backlog → Review direct transition is undefined)
shirokuma-docs items transition {PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER} --to "In Progress"
shirokuma-docs items transition {PLAN_ISSUE_NUMBER} --to "Review"
```

## Plan Issue Approach

Plans are created as child issues of the parent issue (issues with titles starting with "Plan:" or "計画:"). This allows plans to be managed as independent issues, making phase progress visible on GitHub Projects.

### Plan Issue Structure

- **Title**: `Plan: {parent issue title}`
- **Status**: `Review`
- **Labels**: `area:plan`
- **Body**: Full plan content (approach, target files, task breakdown, risks, etc.)

### Plan Issue Status Transitions

Plan issues represent the lifecycle of the plan itself and do not participate in work progress tracking.

| Status | Description | Transition Trigger |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Review | Plan created, awaiting review / code review | Set by `prepare-flow` after plan creation (plan issue) or `implement-flow` chain end (PR) |
| Done | Plan approved | Auto-updated at `implement-flow` chain end, or on manual approval |

**`items integrity` aggregation exclusion**: When auto-deriving parent Issue status, plan issues with the `area:plan` label are excluded from sub-issue status aggregation. This prevents a plan issue remaining in Review from affecting the parent's In Progress derivation.

> `classifyParentStatusInconsistencies` excludes plan issues with the `area:plan` label from sub-issue status aggregation. `syncParentStatus` (reactive derivation) applies the same exclusion.

### Referencing a Plan Issue

Identify the child issue with a title starting with "Plan:" from `subIssuesSummary`, then fetch its body via `items context {plan-issue-number}`.

```bash
shirokuma-docs items context {parent-number}
# → Identify child issue with title starting with "Plan:" from subIssuesSummary
shirokuma-docs items context {plan-issue-number}
# → Read .shirokuma/github/{org}/{repo}/issues/{plan-issue-number}/body.md
```

> **Backward compatibility**: When no plan issue exists but the Issue body contains a `## Plan` section (legacy approach), use it as a fallback.

## Plan-Implementation Deviation: Issue Body Update

The Issue body is the reviewer's primary source of truth. When implementation deviates from the plan, update the Issue body to reflect reality.

### When Update Is Needed

| Criteria | Update needed | No update needed |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| File structure | Added/removed files not in the plan | Modified only planned files |
| Approach | Adopted a different implementation approach | Implemented as planned |
| Scope | Added/removed/split tasks | Completed planned tasks as-is |

### What to Update

1. **Task checklist**: Update `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in `## Plan` / `### Task Breakdown` for completed items
2. **Plan change annotation**: Add strikethrough and change reason at modified sections

```markdown
### Approach

~~Summarize and consolidate into flat files~~
→ Copy into subdirectories (changed during implementation: to avoid knowledge loss risk)
```

### Timing

Not automated as part of the chain. AI judges and executes at these points:

- When a direction change is confirmed during implementation
- During self-review after PR creation
- When a reviewer points out the discrepancy

Follow the comment-first principle: record the deviation reason as a comment before updating the body. The comment must be a primary record containing rationale, alternatives considered, and "why" — not just "what changed".

### Command

```bash
shirokuma-docs items update {number} --body /tmp/shirokuma-docs/{number}-body.md
```

Epic status management, built-in automations, label details, item body maintenance, and item creation guidelines are auto-loaded when the `managing-github-items` skill is executed.

## Comment Retrieval Convention When Reviewing Issues/PRs/Discussions

### `items context` vs Direct Subcommand Usage

| Command | Returns | Use case |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `shirokuma-docs items context {number}` | Body + all comments (cached) | Content review, pre-implementation research |
| `shirokuma-docs items show {number}` | Body only | Checking field values (Status/Priority, etc.) |
| `shirokuma-docs items pr show {number}` | Body only | PR metadata (branches, change counts, etc.) |
| `shirokuma-docs items discussions show {number}` | Body only | Discussion body only |

### Workflow That Assumes Full Comment Loading

When AI reviews the content of an Issue/PR/Discussion, **use `shirokuma-docs items context {number}` to cache comments, then read `.shirokuma/github/{org}/{repo}/issues/{number}/body.md` with the Read tool**. This gives you:

- Issue: body + all comments (plan details, discussion history, blocker information)
- PR: body + review comments + review threads + regular comments
- Discussion: body + all comments + replies (thread structure)

### Comment Writing Convention

| Purpose | Include in comment |
|---------|-------------------|
| Plan decision rationale | Reasoning for selected approach, alternatives considered, constraints discovered (posted as comment on plan issue) |
| Direction change during implementation | Reason for change, alternatives considered, "why" as primary record |
| Blocker notification | Blocker description, scope of impact, resolution conditions |
| Response to review feedback | What was changed, where, and remaining issues |

Comments must contain "why" as a primary record. Avoid comments that only describe "what was done".

### When to Update the Body

Update the body when comments reflect a state that diverges from the Issue/PR's current description. Follow the **comment-first principle**: record in a comment first, then update the body.

| Update needed | No update needed |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Adopted a different approach than planned | Completed implementation as planned |
| Scope (tasks or files) changed | Only implementation details changed |
| Definition of "done" changed | Bug fix or minor adjustment only |
